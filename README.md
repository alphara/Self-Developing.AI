Self Developing AI

# 0

AI which develop AI, full stack, and itself. AI which takes description of application on human language (en, ru, es, etc.) and develops code of the application on programming languages with AI, neural networks, deep learning and so on. AI learns by itself through looking documentation in internet/google. I’m modeling neural networks (strategies) from my brain and brain of other great developers and developing those neural networks in code. I found developers/team who develop the same, and we are develop AI inventor together. AI has voice input/output, accepts different human languages, etc. This Software Engineer AI is absolute model of me and my brain, and even improved model. Also I want create robot who looks and behave like me. All the IT and psychology is in this project. The AI can teach people how to code with the best productivity and performance.

I have an idea about creating AI which develops software. The AI could take a specification, which is input text on human language. Then AI could develop the software according the specification. I assume that we need to apply NLP to create such AI.

I was studying with psychological trainings about how to get model of genius. If some person can do something great, we can get the model of what’s going on inside the brain and body of the genius. Then we can teach other people to apply the model of genius in practice. We could get models of thinking and doing for great developers. We could model complex skill of development of computer software as a bunch of simple skills: how to create a function, how to assign a variable, how to create an algorithm, and so on. Most part of those skills are very well know. We could teach similar neural network as great programmers have in their brains. Such way we could create deep learning algorithm, which develop computer software. Initially, the AI could help to real developer with creating some simple functions. Then more complex algorithms. Then the AI-programmer could write the computer software by itself without human programmer.

We could also create AI, which creates algorithm for deep learning. So AI could develop AI. In some moment, AI could start develop itself. This is an idea of “Self-developing AI”.
